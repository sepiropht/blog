Right now I'm reading a book by Isaac Asimov. I discovered this author because I wanted to read some science fiction, a genre that's completely foreign to me. So I naturally chose to read his book on the history of the Roman Empire in 2 volumes! One on the republic and the other on the empire.

Sunday morning I was reading the chapter on the Punic Wars. The story of Hannibal naturally caught my attention. He is the son of Hamilcar Barca, founder of old Barcelona. I didn't know this city was so old. The father's story was already exceptional but the son's will eclipse it. He crossed the Alps with elephants and besieged Italy for 15 years without ever losing a battle. The Romans were afraid of him and preferred to leave him without an opponent by striking Carthage directly. By trying to protect his city he would finally lose his one and only battle.

But his story doesn't end there, since he would become the city's administrator, turn it around financially and repay the tribute faster than expected. The Romans wouldn't like that, he would soon be forced into exile. He finally dies in present-day Turkey after his house was surrounded by Roman guards who were about to seize him. Even in exile he continued to advise kings to help them rise up against Rome, the obsession of his life.

These stories from a distant past seem so beautiful that you'd think they were invented.

I also have a question: how did he manage to prove it was really him when he met the kings of the Orient? Anyone at that time could have passed themselves off as the great Hannibal, there were no photos or ID cards. Is my question stupid?

Afterwards I played a chess game in division 4. In France I'm making my big comeback after 10 years of absence. So far the results are a bit mixed: 2 losses and 1 win. So I'm playing this 4th game against an opponent who just started competitive chess. White to play and win, find the winning move!
