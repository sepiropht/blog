      <description>In my last article, I explained how Docker saved me when my Raspberry Pi, which hosted all my services, suddenly failed. Indeed, Docker allows for good compartmentalization of configurations and data, and lets you choose where to store them, which in my case was an external hard drive. In case of a failure, you just need to take the hard drive and connect it to another machine, and you&amp;rsquo;re done.</description>

      <description>1. The problem This morning, I had a problem: my server, a Raspberry Pi 2 bought in 2016, no longer starts. I used this old machine to host many services (WireGuard, Nextcloud, Bitwarden, ODPS server, etc.).&#xA;After a few unsuccessful attempts, I gave up on the idea of repairing it and decided to use another one of my servers instead. I unplugged the external hard drive from my Raspberry Pi and plugged it into my other server.</description>
